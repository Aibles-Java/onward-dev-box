# Issue Workflow — onward-dev-box

The full lifecycle for turning a GitHub issue into a merged PR while keeping the
**Digital banking** project board (project #3) and repo memory in sync. Builds on
`git-workflow` (branching/commits) and `create-pr` (PR format); this skill adds the
board + assignee + memory-gate steps around them.

Helper script: `.claude/scripts/issue-board.sh` (needs `gh` with the `project`
scope — `gh auth refresh -s project` if a board step errors on scope).

## The loop

### 0 — (Optional) Estimate first

If the issue's card has no Size/Estimate yet, run the `estimate-issue` skill
before starting — estimating is cleanest before any work biases the number.

### 1 — Start work (do this the moment you pick up an issue)

```bash
.claude/scripts/issue-board.sh start <issue#>
```

This assigns the issue to the authenticated `gh` user and moves its board card to
**In progress** (adding it to the board first if it isn't there). Then branch:

- `git checkout -b feature/<slug> origin/develop` (see `git-workflow` for naming).

### 2 — Implement

Do the work. Mind this repo's sensitive areas from `CLAUDE.md`: `postgres/init/`
(credentials consumer repos depend on), `docker-compose.yml` port mappings (claim
new ports in `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` §4 first), and `.claude/hooks/` (changes
require explicit human confirmation). Anything touching the cross-repo contract
needs a companion change planned in `../feature_flag`.

If the human makes a substantive in-terminal decision along the way, post it back to
the issue — see **Decision comments** below.

### 3 — Save memory BEFORE pushing (enforced)

Run `/save-memory` so decisions + `HANDOFF.md` are recorded, and commit it. The
**memory gate** (`.claude/hooks/pre-push-memory-gate.sh`, wired as a `PreToolUse`
hook on `git push` and as a `.githooks/pre-push` backstop) will **block any push
whose commits touch code but not `.claude/memory/`**. So memory always ships with
the work rather than as a disconnected afterthought.

If a push is legitimately memory-less (e.g. a pure typo fix), override explicitly:
`SKIP_MEMORY_CHECK=1 git push …`.

### 4 — Open the PR

Use the `create-pr` skill. Base is `develop` for `feature/*`. Reference the issue
(e.g. `Closes #<issue#>`) in the Related issue section.

### 5 — Move to Ready For Testing (right after the PR opens)

```bash
.claude/scripts/issue-board.sh ready <issue#>
```

The card moves to **Ready For Testing**, signalling the work is up for review/QA.

### (Optional) When merged / verified

```bash
.claude/scripts/issue-board.sh done <issue#>
```

## Decision comments (human-in-the-loop)

Human-in-the-loop decisions made in the terminal are invisible to teammates reviewing
the issue/PR async. So: whenever the human makes a **substantive** decision while you
are working a linked issue — one that changes scope/plan or spawns a follow-up work
item (e.g. "fix this here vs. file a follow-up issue", "which status to restore a
board card to") — post a short **Decision** comment to that issue, using exactly this
template:

```bash
gh issue comment <issue#> --repo Aibles-Java/onward-dev-box --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
🧑‍⚖️ Decision (human-in-the-loop)
Q: <one-line question>
Options: <a> / <b> / <c>
Chosen: <answer> — <one-line rationale>
EOF
)"
```

(The quoted heredoc — same pattern as `create-pr` — keeps apostrophes/quotes in the
filled-in text from breaking the shell command.)

Rules:

- **Post after the decision resolves**, so the comment captures the answer, not just
  the question. Fire-and-forget: never block or delay the human answering
  in-terminal, and a failed comment must never fail the actual work.
- **Substantive decisions only.** Routine clarifications (which base branch, "is this
  file supposed to be empty?", naming/formatting picks) get **no** comment.
- **Which issue:** derive it from the current branch (`feature/issue-N-…`) or the
  board card moved at step 1. If no issue is linked to the current work, **skip
  silently** — never guess a number.
- **Sanitize.** Post only the templated summary above — never raw question/prompt
  text, file contents, credentials (even local-only ones), or internal reasoning.
- **No duplication.** Issue comments capture *in-flight decisions*;
  `.claude/memory/` captures *durable conventions*; the PR body is the *final
  summary*. Don't repeat the same content across all three.

## Board status vocabulary (exact, case-sensitive)

`Todo` · `In progress` · `Ready For Testing` · `Done` — the script resolves the
field/option IDs at runtime, so refer to statuses by these names.

## Shared, multi-repo board (important)

The "Digital banking" board (project #3) is **org-wide** and holds cards from several
repos, so an issue *number* is not unique across the board — e.g. `feature_flag#4` and
`banking-knowledge-base#4` coexist. `issue-board.sh` disambiguates by filtering every
card lookup on `.content.repository == "Aibles-Java/onward-dev-box"`; it only ever
touches this repo's cards. If you mutate the board by hand (raw `gh project ...`), you
**must** apply the same repo filter — a bare `.content.number==N` match can move
another team's card. (A regression in feature_flag once did exactly this; see
feature_flag issue #12.)

## Boundaries

- Don't move a card to **Ready For Testing** before the PR actually opens.
- Don't bypass the memory gate to "save time" — use `/save-memory`, not
  `SKIP_MEMORY_CHECK`, unless the push genuinely has no session context worth keeping.
- The board lives under the `Aibles-Java` org; the `gh` token must carry the
  `project` scope for any board mutation (read-only `read:project` is not enough).
- Decision comments: substantive decisions only, templated + sanitized, and only when
  an issue is actually linked — when in doubt about the issue number, post nothing.
